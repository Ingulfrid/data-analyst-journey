# 📊 My Journey to Becoming a Data & Business Analyst

Welcome to my learning portfolio.
This repository documents my personal journey from zero to data/business/functional analyst, starting in June 2025. 
My goal is to enter and complete the VDAB Data Analyst course starting in September 2025, 
and ultimately transition into a role where I get to work with data in a meaningful, strategic way — crafting KPIs, dashboards, and data-driven insights that help teams make smarter decisions.

## 🧭 Roadmap
- 📅 June–August 2025: Pre-course study (Python, SQL, Excel, mini-projects)
- 🎓 September 2025–September 2026: VDAB Data Analyst course
- 🧠 Ongoing: Build a portfolio to support applications for Business/Functional Analyst jobs
