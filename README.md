# 📊 My Journey to Becoming a Data & Business Analyst

Welcome to my learning portfolio.

This repository documents my personal transition from beginner to job-ready data/business/functional analyst — starting in June 2025. 
My path combines formal training (VDAB Data Analyst course) with self-directed learning, hands-on portfolio building, and focused skill development.
My long-term goal is to work in a role where I can leverage data meaningfully — crafting KPIs, dashboards, and data-driven insights that help teams and companies make smarter decisions.

## 🧭 Learning Roadmap

This roadmap is split into 5 skill-building phases, designed to complement the VDAB course while filling in gaps and boosting real-world job readiness:

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **0. Orientation** | Understand the data analytics landscape, roles, workflows, and key concepts |
| **1. Tool Fundamentals** | Excel (pivot tables, functions, cleaning), SQL (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY), basic Python (pandas, Jupyter, CSVs), data types & cleaning, basic charts, intro to public datasets, and light exposure to Git and BI tools |
| **2. Practice & Portfolio** | Apply tools on real datasets, begin dashboarding, storytelling & visualization |
| **3. Business Thinking** | Learn KPIs, stakeholder needs, case-style projects; simulate real job tasks |
| **4. Job Readiness** | Finalize portfolio, polish CV/LinkedIn, practice interview scenarios, specialize further |

🧠 Alongside these phases: I’ll build soft skills, presentation techniques, documentation habits, and communication clarity — all essential for analyst work.
