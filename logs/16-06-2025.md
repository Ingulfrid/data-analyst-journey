# ðŸ“… Log â€“ 2024-06-16

### ðŸŽ¯ Focus
- Applied for VDAB Data Analist course (https://www.vdab.be/opleidingen/aanbod/O-AMI-750460/cursus/C-AMI-215049/Data-Analist-HEVERLEE)

- Set up GitHub portfolio repo: `data-analyst-journey`
- Define structure (projects, logs, certs, etc.)
- Wrote first version of `README.md`
- Established log system (Markdown-based, Git-tracked)

### âœ… What I Did
- Created repo and folders:
  - `/projects/`
  - `/logs/`
  - `/certificates/`
  - `/drafts/`
- Wrote initial log system plan (this file!)
- Defined goals and roadmap with ChatGPT analysis and suggestions
- Committed and pushed initial version

### ðŸ¤” What I Learned
- Markdown frontmatter can help structure logs
- GitHub alone is enough to run my learning blog/portfolio
- Staying lean and focused > over-engineering early

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Begin Week 1, Day 2: Excel practice (VLOOKUP, IF, Pivot Tables)
- Create `/resources/excel-practice.md` with formulas + links
- Log progress at end of day
