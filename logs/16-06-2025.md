# ðŸ“… Log â€“ 2025-06-16

### ðŸŽ¯ Focus
- Applied for VDAB Data Analist course ([course link](https://www.vdab.be/opleidingen/aanbod/O-AMI-750460/cursus/C-AMI-215049/Data-Analist-HEVERLEE))
- Set up GitHub portfolio repo: `data-analyst-journey`
- Defined folder structure (projects, logs, certs, drafts, resources)
- Created README, log system, and templates
- Learned GitHub folder-tracking behavior and how to handle `.gitkeep`

### âœ… What I Did
- Created repo and folder structure:
  - `/projects/`, `/logs/`, `/certificates/`, `/drafts/`, `/resources/`
- Wrote and committed:
  - `README.md`
  - `/logs/16-06-2025.md` (this file)
  - Daily and weekly log templates in `/logs/templates/`
- Initialized Git locally via VS Code terminal (PowerShell), linked remote, committed, and pushed
- Handled error caused by empty folders not showing â€” used `.gitkeep` to solve
- Committed `.gitkeep` files and pushed updated structure

### ðŸ¤” What I Learned
- GitHub doesnâ€™t track empty folders unless a file exists inside (e.g. `.gitkeep`)
- PowerShell uses different file creation syntax than Bash (no `echo >`)
- Git can block push when remote has conflicting root commits (used force-push to override)
- Markdown frontmatter is excellent for structuring logs
- GitHub itself is fully sufficient as a public blog and portfolio tracker

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Start **Week 1, Day 2**: Excel training (VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, IF, Pivot Tables)
- Create `/resources/excel-practice.md` to gather reference formulas and learning links
- Log tomorrowâ€™s study results in `17-06-2025.md`
