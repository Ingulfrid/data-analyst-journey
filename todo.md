# 🧩 Current Focus & Next Steps

This file tracks what I'm actively working on in my data analytics learning journey.
It evolves as I progress, and gets updated frequently.

## 🎯 Current focus

🔍 Theory
🛠️ Hands-on
💡 Reflection

- [ ] 🔍 Complete Phase 0 orientation (what analysts do, key concepts, tool landscape)
- [ ] 🔍 Explore example dashboards (Power BI / Tableau Public) and describe in log what KPIs or charts it uses
- [ ] 🛠️ Practice basic Excel skills (pivot tables, IFs, lookups)
- [ ] 🛠️ Complete 3 small SQL challenges (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY) - Use an online sandbox like SQLBolt or Mode Analytics
- [ ] 🛠️ Excel: Load a small public CSV and explore it using filters, sorting, and formulas  
- [ ] 🛠️ SQL: Import same dataset into SQLite or browser-based SQL tool, run basic SELECT, GROUP BY, and WHERE queries
- [ ] 🛠️ Python: Load a CSV in Jupyter using pandas, try basic commands: `df.head()`, `df.describe()`, filtering rows, calculating column means, and plotting a simple bar or line chart
- [ ] 💡  Write reflection on each of the above in `/logs`

## 🧠 Looking Ahead

Planned next:
- Start first real mini-project with public dataset
- Perform full-cycle analysis using either Excel, SQL, or Python  
      → Load data, clean it, explore it, and summarize key insights
- Create a basic dashboard (Excel or Power BI) to visualize 2–3 KPIs from the analysis
- Write a short project summary in `/docs`: goals, method, insights, screenshots
